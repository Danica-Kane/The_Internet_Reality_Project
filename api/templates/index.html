        The Internet Reality Project is an educational resource that aims to equip users with the critical skills necessary to identify 
        fake news and instill confidence in their ability to apply these skills with ease in their everyday lives. 
        <br><br>
        As an industry, digital technologies have undeniably played a significant role in the influx of fake news as of 
        recent years. And as such I believe that it is in part the responsibility of digital technology creators to 
        address this issue as a unified front. This website serves as a mock up for a potential practical, engaging, and acsessible
        educational resource the industry could develop.

        The Internet Reality Project is an unbiased and controlled environment for education surrounding the 
        issue of Fake News. 
        Particularly in recent years this issue has gone from a 
        niche topic to a global debate that politicatial factoctions weponise and that the public fear. 
        Never has humanity been more polorised in opinion, and a lot of this is down 
        to the influence of Fake News. The Intnernet Reality Project aims to bridge the divide 
        and foster the skills needed to identify 
        fact from fiction on the internet. The ability to determine truth from lies should not be an 
        exclusive one. This website is an accessible place where you can educate yourself and 
        go forth as a more responsible conscious internet user.

        Good Luck,
