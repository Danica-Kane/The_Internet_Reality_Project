        First and foremost this website is a school project. 
        Specifically the task behind this project was to create a digital product that addresses a digital technologies issue. 
        The issue I have chosen is Fake News. 
        <br><br>
        The Internet Reality Project is an educational resource that aims to equip users with the critical skills necessary to identify 
        fake news and instill confidence in their ability to apply these skills with ease in their everyday lives. 
        <br><br>
        As an industry, digital technologies have undeniably played a significant role in the influx of fake news as of 
        recent years. And as such I believe that it is in part the responsibility of digital technology creators to 
        address this issue as a unified front. This website is my contribution to that effort. It serves as a mock up 
        for what potential educational resources the industry could develop. The primary goal of these reasources being to make 
        identifying fake news an easy and accessible skill to learn, that is taught in a manner that is both engaging and practical.

        The Internet Reality Project is first and foremost a product born of necessity. 
        It serves as an unbiased and controlled environment for education surrounding an 
        issue which has become ever more present in modern day society. Fake News. 
        Misinformation and Fake News have always been present in human societies, but it is 
        particularly in recent years that discussion around this issue has gone from a 
        niche topic to a global debate that politicatial factoctions would weponise as a 
        tool for persuasion and division between the people of our society. Never has 
        humanity been more polorised when it comes to opinion, and a lot of this is down 
        to the influence of Fake News. The Intnernet Reality Project aims to bridge the divide 
        between opinionated factions, and foster the skills needed to help all of us identify 
        fact from fiction in the realm that is the wild west of the internet. Allowing for us 
        to develop a shared sense of reality that gives us at least some foundation of 
        agreement to exist apon. The ability to determine truth from lies should not be an 
        exclusive one, everybody has the right to be confident in their ability to disern fake 
        from real news. This website is an accessible place where you can educate yourself and 
        go forth as a more responsible conscious internet user.

        Good Luck,
